4. Check if everything is OK with your local setup by opening [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## Task description:
Main goal of the task is to create and register a simple service worker which will help with difficult calculations.
When you will start this project you will be able to see two buttons. First button starts difficult calculations without
service workers approach and as a result blocks a page. Your task will be to implement same calculations using service
workers approach on the second button click. There are some comments in ./src/js/index.js and ./src/js/worker.js files
and you will need only to write code under these comments. You should not change anything elsewhere.
